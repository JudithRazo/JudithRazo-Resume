        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello I'm Judith! I am currently a second year in the Undeclared Program at UCR. I hope to declare as an English major by the end of the year so I can pursue a career as an English teacher in the future! Here are some of the Pesonal Insight Questions that got me into UCR and describe my goals and what I deeply care about. The first describes my background: I believe being the oldest child of parents who immigrated from Mexico is what sets me apart from other UC applicants. I had to grow up quicker than most kids and help my parents navigate  a country that was foreign to them. My first experience as a product of immigrants occured when I was only 6 years-old. My first day of kindergarten, I walked in not knowing a word in English, but because I was motivated to help my parents succeed in this country, I was able to catch up and learn English within two months. I continued to learn and eventually, I started translating to my parents; I even taught my dad basic English to help him communicate with the supervisors at his job. Additionally, because I was the oldest, I had to learn how to pay the bills, make appointments, and translate important paperwork.The responsibilities that I have had have shown me that I am capable of anything as long as I am motivated to do it. I have learned that being the oldest sibling especially in an immigrant family is a difficult duty, but it has made me the responsible and hard working person I am today. I am able to handle task like looking after my siblings, doing chores around my house, and being a translator for my family while also attending school and participating in multiple extracurricular activities. These experiences have helped me prepare to become a successful college student because I am familiar with managing many responsibilities at once. I have become independent early on in my life and realized that I have to be ready to do tasks on my own. I have become a diligent and resilient person; I put in constant effort into anything I do despite how difficult it is. I am adaptable and even when a task is extremely foreign to me, I still get it done because Iâ€™ve been doing so since I was child.  Although I struggled with responsibility when I was younger, I am grateful for the qualities I have gained through my experience. 

 <br><br>

        The most significant challenge I have ever faced is overcoming my anxiety. I always had a feeling of fear that I carried with me all the time and I couldnâ€™t get rid of. I remember during elementary my anxiety was so bad that it prevented me from communicating properly with others. I was too scared to make friends and too nervous to ask teachers questions if I needed help. This unfortunately impacted my grade in math since I barely understood the topic, but I was afraid to ask for help and my testing anxiety contributed as well. My anxiety progressively got worse throughout middle school and carried on into my sophomore year of high school. I was too anxious to ask for help when I needed it and I felt like I wasnâ€™t reaching my full potential. I was frustrated that I was allowing my anxiety to keep me from doing what I wanted to do, so I challenged myself to overcome my fear. I decided to join the Drama club at my high school because I knew that it would help me overcome the anxiety that plagued me in my day-to-day life. By pushing myself with this involvement, I managed to successfully perform in a showcase in front of an auditorium full of students. The experience was terrifying, but I was finally able to overcome my anxiety. I knew that if I was able to perform in front of a hundred students then I can surely ask a teacher a question. I repeatedly told myself that no question is too foolish to ask. I tend to be afraid of what I canâ€™t control, but I realized that my education is an aspect of my life that I can control, so I found solace in that. I learned that I canâ€™t let my anxiety and fear prevent me from doing what I love and need to do. I know I will always be anxious by nature, because it is not something that will ever permanently go away, but I will never let that fear hold me in place.

        For the past three years, one of my most important responsibilities has been being an AVID tutor and mentor for students at my previous middle school. I am responsible for guiding these students not only towards academic excellence, but also personal excellence. I play an essential role in preparing them for the struggles they might face in high school like balancing school work and extracurriculars or how to become more proactive with their responsibilities. I do not expect these students to be perfect, in fact, I make sure to teach them that perfection is not everything, that it is okay for them to get a B in a class or say no to an extracurricular. I also constantly remind them to not be afraid of asking questions when they are struggling with a subject. I try to be the guide I wish I had when I became a freshman. I learned how important it is for these students to have someone to rely on at this age where they are just figuring out who they are. I know I personally struggled at their age so I understand what they are going through. I started tutoring as a freshman and now I am going to be a mentor as a senior, the first students I tutored are now juniors and I am proud of all of them. Seeing them grow and succeed has been inspiring and one of the best gifts I could have received from this experience. I learned that I have the potential to positively impact someoneâ€™s educational journey and that reaffirmed to me that I can manifest impact when I dedicate myself to a goal of mine.This responsibility has taught me how to be a leader and although it was difficult at first, I am glad I had the opportunity to become a better person alongside these students. Most importantly, the lessons I give them serve as a reminder to follow my own advice. They have inspired me to continue helping people in the future whether it be the next group of middle schoolers or my peers.
